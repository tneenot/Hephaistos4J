{"name":"Hephaistos4j","tagline":"Hey developpers! You don't know how to proceed with your problem ? Look for Hephaistos4J: it gives you an answer!","body":"### Welcome to Hephaistos4J Pages.\r\nHephaistos4J is a java library that improves some elements to make development more easy. This library contains some elements to bring response to some redudant problems encounters during development like controlled collections, range number with limits controls...\r\n\r\n### Hephaistos4J is free\r\nHephaistos4j is distributed under GPL licence. You can use it and redistribute it like you want, according to GPL licence.\r\n\r\n### Other projects with Hephaistos4J and contributors\r\nI'd like to port Hephaistos4J under other development languages (like C++, python...). Don't hesitate to help me or fork this project and build your own version under your favourite language !\r\n\r\n### Hephaistos philosphy\r\nHephaistos is a grec divinity in charge of to build some tools and arms for other divinities. The aim of Hephaistos4J is to build a library with some miscelleneaous mechanisms to help other developpers to get clean code, strong and more concise Object Oriented code. \r\n\r\nEach new concept must be tested plentifully with xUnit frameworks and the production code must be commented to help developper to use each concept. If you encounter a redudant problem during your development and you have an idea that can help others, you can implemented it under Hephaistos4J, test it and distribute it.\r\n\r\nBut to avoid to have plenty of concepts with the risk of redudant solutions with native Java API (or other standard port language API), it ask you to avoid to implement a concept that is existing yet. If you like to improve an existing concept of your favorite API in this case use the encapsulation to avoid to overload existing API. It seems this approach less confuse rather than \"to reinvent the wheel\" !\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nHephaistos4J is building originally by Tioben Neenot (tioben.neenot@laposte.net). Don't hesitate to fork me and talk about some new features you'd like to see into Hephaistos4J.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot and enjoy your code with Hephaistos4J !\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
