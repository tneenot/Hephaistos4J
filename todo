org.hlib4j.collection (src):
 - there is a problem with the hierarchy for FilteredList. It would be inherit of a FilteredCollection and AbstractList to avoid redundancy code! But it's impossible with Java. So is it necessary to create an AbstractFilteredList and an AbstractFilteredCollection ? I think no, because makeFiltered like methods are wrappers. But it's necessary for all common methods of the FiltredList to implement a FilteredCollection field to use them. For other methods specifics to List implementation, we will use specific wrapper method on the wrapped list like.
 - about methods into Collections class. Try to build methods with template, rather than to have 3 createFiltered like methods.

 org.hlib4j.collection (test):
 - create template tests to test each kind of collections type.
 - build a random valid data test split into to kind of elements: valid values and invalid values.
 - it will be necessary to get some several methods tools like these:
  - return a value from a valid domain,
  - return a value from an invalid domain,
  - build a random value for a valid domain,
  - build a random value for an invalid domain.
