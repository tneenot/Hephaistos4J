Concept classes to define dynamic class definition with user properties. These classes allow to group several classes
type under the
same concept. This is the case while some classes definition are the same but the behavior can be differed according to
internal rules
(eg.: write access according to specific definition as rights user for example). Sometimes is not sufficient to define
one class by rule
because they are so many rules. In this case is very more efficient to define only a generic concept as base classes and
to specify
all rules into a definition file.<br><br>

All classes in this package suggest a solution to manage this case.
