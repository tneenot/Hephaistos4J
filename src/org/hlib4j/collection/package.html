Defines collections controlled by rules to accept or reject
automatically some data according to {@link org.hlib4j.concept.Rule}
definition. These collections ensure to keep easily collection
coherence according to a control rule links with theses collections.
These conveniences classes ensure a coherence collection without to
take account others methods that they already exist into Java API.
<br>
<br> Several kinds of collections are improving by {@link
org.hlib4j.collection.Collections} class for each kind of basis
collections like {@code java.util.Collection
&lt;ElementType&gt;}, {@code java.util.Map
&lt;K
,V&gt;} and {@code java.util.List
&lt;ElementType&gt;}.
With these implementations it's easy to define a collection behavior in
its source code to ensure no hazardous data into its collections
during collection's life.<br>
