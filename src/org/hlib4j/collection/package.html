Defines some collections controlled by rules to accept or reject
automatically some data according to a predicate
definition. These collections ensure to keep easily collection
coherence according to a control rule links with theses collections.
These conveniences classes ensure a coherence collection by using standard Java API.
<br>
<br> Several kinds of collections are improving by {@link
org.hlib4j.collection.Collections} class for each kind of basis
collections like {@code java.util.Collection
<ElementType>}, {@code java.util.Map
  <K
    ,V>} and {@code java.util.List
    <ElementType>}.
      With these implementations it's easy to define a collection behavior in
      its source code to ensure no hazardous data into its collections
      during collection's life.<br>
