# Hephaistos4J
Hephaistors for Java, a library to help the developer to get a more concise and OO code.

This library contains some features to help the developer to build better software with a simple and robust API. You'll find some features to manage i18n into your application, or to use automatic filtered collections...

Some unit tests and samples are allowing within this project to help you to be familiar with these concepts.

All new suggestions are welcome to improve features and performances for Hephaistos4J (hlib4j).

Thanks to test hlib4j and for your comments.
