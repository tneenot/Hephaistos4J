These classes collect all unit tests and samples for tioben library
API. Samples application are localising into
<code>org.hlib4j.samples</code>
package. It's preferring to put sample code into a specific package
whose name doesn't correspond to sources packages name from tioben
library. With this rule we can control if no limitation exists due to
packages names and classes visibilities for future usage.
